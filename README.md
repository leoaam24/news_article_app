# Development Environment

I used Android Studio for my development environment. And I used Flutter and Dart for my programming language. The app is using dynamic information from newsapi.org.

# Future Work

* There are errors within the project that needs to be fixed. They don't break the app but needs to be cleaned for full release.
* I need to fix the browser launch when the external site link is clicked within the app
* I need to add more interactivity like adding more news and let users scroll through the news cards.
